            "The commander of Nasa's next mission to the Moon said that he and his crew would \"see things that no human has ever seen\".",
            "Reid Wiseman told a news conference that it was likely that his spacecraft would fly over large areas of the Moon that previous Apollo missions had never mapped.",
            "Yesterday, Nasa announced it hoped it would be able tolaunch the first crewed Moon mission in 50 years as early as February 2026.",
            "Mission specialist Christina Koch explained that the astronauts would be able to study the lunar surface in exquisite detail for a full three hours.",
            "\"Believe it or not, human eyes are one of the best scientific instruments that we have,\" she said.",
            "\"Our geologists are beyond excited for our eyes to look at the Moon, and we've been training how to turn those observations into answering some of the biggest questions of our time, questions like 'Are we alone?' We can answer that by going to Mars in the future, and this mission can be the first step in bringing that answer back to team humanity.\"",
            "The Artemis II mission is the second launch of the Artemis programme, whose aim is to land astronauts and eventually establish a long-term presence on the lunar surface.",
            "Commander Reid told reporters the name the crew had given  to their spacecraft and why they chose it.",
            "\"Peace and hope for all humankind, that is what we really want. We are bringing together the world, and when you squeeze it all down, it will create magic. So we're going to fly around the Moon in the spacecraft 'Integrity'.",
            "All four astronauts said they took inspiration from the Apollo Moon missions of the 1960s and early 1970s.",
            "Read more about the four astronauts below.",
            "Christina Koch decided to become an astronaut after seeing a picture of the Earth taken by Bill Anders, a crew member of the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. For her, the Artemis II flight is literally a dream come true because it, just like Apollo 8, will fly around the Moon to help pave the way for a Moon landing.",
            "Although Christina was born 11 years after the photograph was taken, she kept a poster of the Earth rising above the lunar surface. Just as that moment inspired a generation living through the 1960s, she said in a Nasa interview that she hoped her mission would enable a new generation to live though what they lived through and, as it did at the time, make the world a more optimistic place.",
            "\"The fact that it was a human behind that lens made that picture so much more profound and changed the way we thought of our own home,\" she said.",
            "\"The Moon was not just a symbol for thinking about our place in the universe, it is a beacon for science and understanding where we came from.\"",
            "Christina was an engineer who became an astronaut in 2013. She lived and worked on the International Space Station for almost all of 2019, spending a total of 328 consecutive days in space and famously participated in the first all-female spacewalk. Her hobbies include surfing, rock and ice climbing, programming, community service, triathlons, yoga, backpacking, woodworking, photography and travel.",
            "Christina is set to be the first woman to go to the Moon.",
            "This will be the first time Jeremy Hansen will have been in space. He too was inspired by the astronauts on Apollo 8. At the time the world was riven with wars and conflict.",
            "\"When they flew around the Moon just before Christmas in 1968 there was a lot going on the world, and people realised it was a really tough time. People were struggling in many different ways and and I think we can all resonate with that today.",
            "\"And I remember reading about a postcard that Bill Anders got when he got back, and it just simply, all that was written on it was, 'you saved 1968'.\"",
            "With his Buzz Lightyear-like square jaw and clean-cut appearance, he comes across as the archetypical heroic astronaut. As a Canadian, he is set to become the first non-American to go to the Moon.",
            "His message is one of unity and inspiration not just for the US, but the entire world.",
            "\"The Artemis missions have set such an ambitious goal for humanity that is inspiring contributions from around the World, not just one nation is inspired and moved by this, but nations around the globe are coming together\".",
            "Jeremy was a fighter pilot, physicist and aquanaut before he joined the Canadian Space Agency in 2009. During his time with the CSA, he became the first Canadian to lead astronaut training at Nasa's Johnson Space Centre. He is married with three children and enjoys sailing, rock climbing, and mountain biking.",
            "Those who have met Victor say he is the most charismatic of the quartet and the most sharply dressed, with designer brown leather boots making him look good even in an orange flight suit.",
            "\"Pushing ourselves to explore is core to who we are,\" he said in a Nasa interview. \"It is part of being human.\"",
            "Like is fellow crew, his words hark back to a bygone space age, and the words of then President John F. Kennedy in 1962: \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.\"",
            "Victor goes on to say: \"It is in our nature. We go out to explore, to learn where we are, why we are, understanding the big questions about our place in the universe.\"",
            "Victor's call sign is IKE, which is reputedly short for \"I Know Everything\", acknowledging his three master's degrees: in flight test engineering, systems engineering and military operational art and science.",
            "Victor was selected as a Nasa astronaut in 2013. He has previously served as the pilot of Nasa's SpaceX Crew-1 mission to the International Space Station as part of Expedition 64.",
            "He was born in Pomona, California, and is married with four children.",
            "Victor is set to be the first black person to go to the Moon.",
            "Reid Wiseman also brings back echoes of the 1960 Apollo Moonshots when he says that he hopes the Artemis II mission will be looked back on as a \"tiny step in having humans on Mars and a sustained presence on the Moon\".",
            "His words echo those of another space commander, Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the Moon: \"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\".",
            "Although Reid is the mission's commander, he takes care to include his crew.",
            "\"When I look at Victor, Christina and Jeremy, they want to go do this mission, they are keenly driven, they are humble to a fault. It is so cool to be around them.\"",
            "Reid is widowed and despite a distinguished career as an astronaut, he considers his time as an only parent as his \"greatest challenge and the most rewarding phase\" of his life.",
            "In one of the very few interviews Neil Armstrong ever gave, I asked him in 1996 whether the dream of humans living and working on the Moon and going on to other planets would ever come back. His reply was:",
            "\"The reality may have faded, but the dream is still there, and it will come back in time.\"",
            "He would have been heartened to have heard these words from each of the Artemis II crew.",
            "Christina: \"We are ready.\"",
            "Jeremy: \"We are going.\"",
            "Victor: \"To the Moon.\"",

        "data": "6 hours ago",
        "conteudo": [
            "Nicolas Sarkozy is back where he used to be â€“ dominating the news and dividing the nation.",
            "Thirteen years after he left office, he is about to become the first former French president to be sent to prison after getting a five-year term for criminal conspiracy.",
            "And the circumstances are full of the same sulphurous contention that used once to mark his every move.",
            "Fresh from his sentencing in the \"Libyan money\" trial on Thursday, he spoke with incandescent rage about the \"limitless hatred\" of which he said he was still a victim.",
            "Former French president Sarkozy given five-year sentence after Libya case",
            "From the moment he emerged as a champion of the right, Sarkozy was convinced he had been the target of a left-wing cabal within the French judiciary and media.",
            "And with this sentence - he thinks â€“ has come more incontrovertible proof.",
            "Why, his supporters are asking, did the court clear him of three of the four charges weighing against him: illegal party funding, embezzlement of Libyan funds, and corruption?",
            "Why did the court only convict him of the last charge â€“ the \"catch-all\" one of \"criminal association\" (often thrown at drugs gang members when investigators have nothing else to go on)?",
            "And why â€“ having convicted him on this lesser charge â€“ did the court then give him such a humiliating and draconian punishment? Not only did they send a 70 year-old man to five years in jail, it was a shocking 20 years after the offence.",
            "They also stipulated that the sentence was not \"suspensive\" â€“ in other words they said he would go to jail even if he lodged an appeal, even though in French law pending an appeal he is in theory still innocent.",
            "Just when you thought the old passions for and against the man were beginning to fade, suddenly they are back with a vengeance.",
            "Many will feel some sympathy with Sarkozy â€“ not necessarily that he is entirely guiltless in this matter of seeking Libyan campaign money.",
            "But they will see some truth in his claims of victimisation: that there are indeed some in the Paris \"politico-mediatic-judicial\" establishment who loathe the former president and rejoice in bringing him down.",
            "Look through another lens, though, and Sarkozy is not some hard-done-by ex-head of state, but an egotistical and highly influential political operator who has consistently pushed the law to its limits in order to get his way.",
            "Why else would there be such a litany of lawsuits against him? Why else would Sarkozy already have been convicted on two other charges of corruption â€“ once for trying to suborn a judge, and another time for illegal campaign funding?",
            "And if the court has now decided to throw the book at him in the Libya affair,  maybe it is because the charge of trying to elicit election funds from a foreign dictator is actually a rather serious one.",
            "It is all relevant today because even though Sarkozy is no longer the influential figure that some make him out to be, the arguments about this case echo through the hall of ruins that are French politics.",
            "The right and far-right take up his cause, crying foul about left-wing judicial over-reach. Marine Le Pen â€“ herself banned from running for the presidency because of a \"no-suspension\" clause in her own conviction early this year â€“ was first to denounce the \"injustice\".",
            "And the left sees it all as more evidence of rich men's privilege â€“ the powerful getting more powerful by blithely ignoring the law.",
            "Nicolas Sarkozy has long since left office, and there is no prospect of his returning.  He is a figure of the past.  But his case lays bare the divisions in a very divided country.",

        "data": "1 day ago",
        "conteudo": [
            "The first time he throttled the MiGâ€‘21 to full power, soaring 20km above the Earth at twice the speed of sound, the young fighter pilot felt utterly weightless, as if the sky itself had let him go.",
            "\"At Mach 2 you can feel the lightness in the stomach. The MiGâ€‘21's turns at that speed are vast - banking sharply can carry you over many kilometres before completing a full arc,\" recalls Air Marshal (retired) Prithvi Singh Brar. He joined the Air Force in 1960, switched to the Soviet jet in 1966, and flew it for the next 26 years.",
            "\"I loved flying the MiG-21 the way a bird loves the sky. In combat it protected me - when the hawk comes for the bird, the clever bird gets away. That's what the MiG-21 was for me,\" he told me.",
            "After six decades of admiration - and later, infamy - India's most iconic warplane is finally taking its last flight on Friday. At its peak, the MiGâ€‘21 was the backbone of the Indian Air Force (IAF), making up two-thirds of its fighter fleet. It inspired fierce loyalty among its pilots, yet also acquired the grim nickname \"flying coffin\" after a series of deadly crashes in its twilight years.",
            "According toofficial figures, between 1966 and 1980, India procured 872 MiG aircraft of various models.",
            "Between 1971â€‘72 and April 2012, 482 MiG crashes were recorded, claiming 171 pilots, 39 civilians, eight service personnel and one aircrew, \"caused by both human error and technical defects\". There is no official update of the data since.",
            "\"The MiG-21 has a chequered legacy. The fighter was the mainstay of the IAF for over three decades and served in various roles in all of India's conflicts since the 1965 Pakistan war,\" says Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm. \"However, starting in the early 2000s, the fighter became better known for its high crash rate. Pilots look back at the MiG-21 fondly, but the aircraft stayed in service far longer than it should have,\" he adds.",
            "Designed by the Soviets and first inducted in 1963, the needle-nosed MiG-21 was razor-slim, blisteringly fast at altitude and could climb with ferocious speed. At its peak, the jet flew with more than 50 air forces - from the Soviet Union, China and India to Egypt, Iraq and Vietnam - making it one of the most widely operated supersonic jets in history.",
            "In India, where the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) began license-building it in the mid-1960s, the MiG-21 became the cornerstone of IAF squadrons, prized for its versatility across multiple combat roles.",
            "Inside the MiGâ€‘21 cockpit, pilots say, there was little comfort - just a single seat and the sky pressing in all around.",
            "The air-conditioning - built for Russian winters - was barely adequate in scorching Indian summers. At low levels, cockpits often turned stifling and pilots could lose a kilo or more of body weight during a single sortie, remembers Air Marshal (retired) Vinod K Bhatia.",
            "\"Most of the sorties I flew were around 30 minutes long, so the discomfort was bearable. In the end, however, it was all part of the game and still enjoyable,\" he told me.",
            "Originally a high-altitude interceptor built for speed and short-range climbs to reach the enemy over short distances, the MiGâ€‘21 was quickly adapted by the IAF for close combat and ground attacks.",
            "By the 1971 war with Pakistan, it had become a formidable multi-role fighter, though in 1965 war it was still new and mainly an interceptor. The MiGâ€‘21 also shaped India's defence ties with Russia and helped jump-start its own aerospace industry.",
            "\"We adapted the aircraft to Indian conditions in a remarkable way. Though it had design limitations and wasn't built for close combat, we pushed it beyond what Russian test pilots and manuals taught, mastering close combat flying in a truly impressive manner,\" says Air Marshal Brar.",
            "That adaptability came to define its role in the 1971 war. MiG-21s carried out low-level night strikes deep into Pakistani territory. A MiG-21 formation struck the governor's house in Dhaka, blasting rockets through its roof ventilators.",
            "\"Each aircraft carried two 500kg bombs, and I flew three-to-four such missions.  Taking off from Amritsar, we were insidePakistan within 35 minutes, struck our targets 250km deep and raced back through Rajasthan - the shortest way out,\" says Air Marshal Brar.",
            "Every fighter jet has its quirks and the MiGâ€‘21 was no exception - fast descents and even high-speed stalls were part of its character, according to Air Marshal Bhatia. \"Master it, respect it and it was a beautiful airplane to fly,\" he says.",
            "For the pilots who flew it, the MiGâ€‘21's tarnished reputation in later years is undeserved. \"The media was very unkind to the aircraft,\" said one.",
            "Defence analyst Rahul Bedi says there's a lot of \"misplaced nostalgia around MiG-21 because it was responsible for so many deaths\". Many attribute frequent crashes to ageing airframes and stretched maintenance cycles.",
            "\"MiGâ€‘21's biggest challenge was its engine and high landing speed, which made descents tricky on short runways and contributed to many accidents - often blamed on pilot error. Attempts to retire the fighters were repeatedly stalled by inefficiency and bureaucratic inertia,\" says Mr Bedi.",
            "The air force had to keep extending the MiG-21's service life as replacements were not available. The light combat aircraft meant to replace it was conceived of in 1981, first flew in 2001 and, even now, decades later, only two squadrons are operational.",
            "With its last two MiG-21 squadrons retired, India will now have 29 fighter units against a sanctioned 42. Yet, for the pilots who flew it, the MiGâ€‘21 was never just a machine - it was a partner in the sky.",
            "Air Marshal Brar felt that bond first-hand, flying his last sortie out of the northern city of Chandigarh just two days before his retirement in July 2000.",
            "\"I was in the sky once more, like a bird taking flight for the last time. When I landed and stepped out of the cockpit, I felt completely content.\"",

            "\"I grew up in a family where my parents were educators, and myself I spent all my life in higher education, at seven universities on three continents,\" Mutharika commented in 2017, during an address at the UK's Oxford University.",

            "Mutharika returned home to serve as an adviser to the new president and in 2009, he was elected as an MP for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).",

            "But the succession plans were abruptly interrupted in April 2012.",
            "At the age of 78, the president suffered a cardiac arrest, and died. Mutharika paid a glowing tribute to the late leader at his funeral, describing him as \"my brother, my friend and also my hero\".",
            "With the presidency vacant, a power struggle ensued. Malawi's constitution stipulated that if the head of state dies in office, the vice-president takes over, but Bingu had fallen out with his vice-president, Joyce Banda, over the controversial plans to install his brother.",
            "The DPP had expelled Banda, who subsequently formed a new party, the People's Party (PP), but refused to step down as vice-president.",
            "When the president died, his supporters tried to install Mutharika as leader in defiance of the constitution, but ultimatelyBanda prevailed and became Malawi's first female president.",
            "Mutharika was charged with treason after being accused of being part of a plot to hide his brother's death to give him time to manoeuvre to keep Banda out of the presidency.",
            "He dismissed the charges as frivolous and politically motivated - and they were dropped after he was elected president in 2014, defeating Banda and Chakwera with just over 36% of the vote.",
            "Mutharika's supporters say his first stint in power uplifted Malawi, pointing to the billions of dollars of Chinese loans he secured in order to revamp the country's infrastructure.",
            "Inflation also dropped significantly during Mutharika's first term. When he succeeded Banda, the inflation rate was at 24% percent - by the time he left, it had shrunk to single digits.",
            "But Mutharika's tenure also saw blackouts, food shortages and more of the corruption scandals that have long plagued Malawian politics.",
            "In 2018, Malawi's anti-corruption agencyaccused Mutharika of receiving a kickback from a 2.8bn kwacha ($1.6m; Â£1.2m) contractto supply food to the police.",
            "Malawians took to the streets to protest but he was later cleared of any wrongdoing.",
            "He has regularly defended himself as a proponent of the fight against corruption and extravagance, telling the BBC in 2015 that he was \"the only president in Africa that travels commercial\".",
            "Although Mutharika weathered the corruption allegations, he ended up losing the presidency in one of the most dramatic moments in Malawi's political history.",
            "Mutharika ran for a second term in 2019 and after the votes were counted, he was declared the victor.",
            "However, the Constitutional Court later annulled the election, saying there had been widespread tampering, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on results sheets. Commentators mockingly referred to Mutharika as the \"Tipp-Ex\" president.",
            "Judges ordered a re-run for 2020 and, astonishingly, Chakwera won with 59% of the vote.",
            "Although Mutharika branded the re-run \"unacceptable\", the Constitutional Court gained international acclaim for safeguarding democracy and refusing to be influenced by presidential power.",
            "He suggested he would not run for office again, but surprised many by entering this year's presidential race, saying his supporters wanted him to save the country from Chakwera.",
            "Since Mutharika left office, inflation has soared past 30%. Cyclone Freddy, a punishing drought, dwindling foreign reserves and other factors have pushed many Malawians into extreme poverty.",
            "During campaign speeches this year, Mutharika asked the public in the local Chichewa language: \"Munandisowa eti? Mwakhaula eti? (You miss me right? You have suffered, right?)\".",
            "But Mutharika was rarely seen in public during the campaign, in contrast to Chakwera who held numerous rallies across Malawi.",
            "As a result, speculation about Mutharika's health is rife and there are questions about whether he has the stamina to lead Malawi again at the age of 85.",
            "Regardless, voters have put their trust in him. He even triumphed in areas known to be Chakwera strongholds, such as the capital, Lilongwe, and Nkhotakota.",
            "While his political career has been eventful, Mutharika's personal life is relatively quiet. The AFP news agency describes him as \"reserved\" while  South Africa's Mail & Guardian wrote that \"friends say he is a studious man, more at ease with books than political rallies\".",
            "Mutharika has three children from his first wife Christophine, who died in 1990. In June 2014, he married former DPP parliamentarian Gertrude Maseko.",

            "The Matai'an Creek barrier lakeis about 11km (7 miles) away from downstream communities.",
            "It held some 91 million tonnes of water, enough to fill 36,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. About three-quarters of that water was suddenly released after the lake burst its banks on Tuesday, killing at least 14 people and injuring 32 others. Forty-six people are still unaccounted for.",
            "Emergency services said the water was metres deep in Guangfu, the town worst hit. It rose as high as the second floor of a house in some places and was about one-floor deep in the town centre.",
            "The force of the water unleashed by the lake burst could be compared to a tsunami, said Chen Wen Shan, emeritus professor of geology at National Taiwan University.",
            "\"The kinetic energy could even be greater than that of a tsunami. The flow speed can exceed 100km/h [62mph] per hour,\" he told the BBC. \"Although the energy decreases once it reaches the plains, it still remains powerful and fast - far beyond what a typical river embankment can handle.\"",
            "Survivors in Guangfu said they received no warning from the authorities immediately before disaster struck.",
            "But Prof Chen said the academic community had sounded the alarm bell before, asuniversities were closely monitoring the water level of the barrier lakeand worked with authorities on the emergency plans.",
            "\"With the typhoon approaching, we could estimate the rainfall. We knew the water could overflow the lake this time. Part of the dam also collapsed, which caused a large volume of water. But even this volume was within our estimates,\" he said.",
            "\"Failing to evacuate residents properly is one of the factors why the disaster became so severe.\"",
            "On Monday 22 September, a day before Ragasa neared the island, Hualien authorities issued warnings, evacuated about 7,000 people and set up three evacuation centres. Meanwhile, the central government repeatedly urged the county administration to accelerate the evacuations.",
            "But the evacuation was \"not mandatory\" and local officials only called on the public to go to higher ground, Hualien county councillor Yang Hua-mei told the BBC.",
            "It was shortly before 15:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Tuesday when the barrier lake overflowed. Officials had expected it would take the floodwater two hours to reach inhabited areas downstream and only people living near the river would be affected.",
            "But within an hour, vast quantities of water were pouring into Guangfu Township, where 12,000 people live.",
            "\"There were no special flooding warnings and no broadcast,\" an administrator of a high school in Guangfu told the BBC on condition of anonymity. The school was designated an evacuation centre, so he'd originally been tasked with helping evacuees.",
            "He said he'd just finished lunch at around 15:00 when he heard the lake had burst its banks.",
            "\"Within 10 minutes, water spread to the campus from the street. The 400-sq-mile sports ground was submerged,\" he said. Chairs, tables, refrigerators and even cars were soon floating.",
            "\"If I'd still been on the street, I wouldn't have been able to reach higher ground. There were lots of objects floating in the water. I could have been hit or even electrocuted.\"",
            "The administrator said officials might have underestimated Ragasa's impact - the lake had not breached its banks when a weaker typhoon hit last month.",

            "\"Rural elderly residents usually receive information through door-to-door communication. It's unclear how the local authorities had informed them and managed the situation,\" said Awa. Hualien's population is ageing, and many of its older residents don't use smartphones.",
            "\"Many elderly residents are also bedridden because of chronic illness, and no one could help them,\" Ms Yang said.",
            "But Prof Chen pointed out there were no quick solutions. For barrier lakes made up of harder bedrock, small blasting operations can be carried out to divert the water, he said. But in this case, the lake is formed of looser earth and rocks.",
            "\"Also, there are no roads leading to the mountains, so heavy machinery cannot be deployed.\"",
            "Taiwan has plenty of experience of barrier lakes - 88 have been formed on the island since the 1970s, according to Taiwan's Public Television Service. Of those 57% were formed after typhoons; 23% from earthquakes. Most disappear within a year, although four have been there for decades.",
            "But Taiwan's public have little understanding of barrier lakes, former interior minister Lee Hong-yuan, a trained civil engineer, told local media. He said many researchers were witnessing the bursting of a barrier lake for the first time.",
            "Hualien, which is nearly 90% mountainous, is no stranger to natural disasters, either. The county is often the first location on Taiwan to face typhoons, and its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire means it's prone to earthquakes.",
            "The calamities in the past two years, including a fatal magnitude 7.1 earthquake in 2024, have devastated the county's tourism industry, Ms Yang said. Many scenic spots and routes in the world-famous Taroko Gorge National Park are still shut after the quake.",
            "The county also has the largest Indigenous population in Taiwan, with Awa's husband being one of them. The couple started the bookshop four years ago with the mission of preserving the history of Indigenous people - and it moved to its current location just a few months ago.",
            "Now, the bookshop is drenched in mud and they are taking stock of the damage.",
            "\"I am really sad because some of the books have already run out of print,\" she said.",

            "The H-1B programme is often associated with the giants of the US tech sector. Amazon tops the list of beneficiaries, with more than 10,000 H-1B visas approved in the first half of 2025. Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google each secured more than 4,000 visas through the programme through June.",
            "None of the companies responded to requests for comment.",
            "But while just 30 employers  - mainly big tech companies - dominate the programme, accounting for anestimated 40% of the new H-1B visas available, it is not just the behemoths that are poised to be affected by Trump's executive order.",
            "Startups, as well as smaller firms beyond tech, also employ workers through H-1B visas. For them, a six-figure fee per applicant could be crippling.",
            "\"If you're a startup with new technology, and you've got some venture capital money but you're worried about burning through it too quickly, this could kill you,\" said John Skrentny, a professor at the University of California, San Diego who studies STEM workforce development.",
            "\"What the Trump administration's plan doesn't seem to acknowledge is that not every company can spend $100,000 on a visa,\" he added.",
            "Beyond the technology industry, organisations in industries such as education and healthcare, both of which employ foreign skilled workers through the H-1B programme, are also grappling with what the six-figure fee might mean.",
            "\"There's no way that we can afford $100,000,\" said Karen Brady, the chief executive at Ryther, a behavioural health nonprofit based in Seattle. \"In terms of future hiring, we won't be doing any more H-1B visas.\"",
            "The behavioural health sector has been grappling with a workforce shortage amid a spike in need since the pandemic, Ms Brady said. Hiring employees through the H-1B programme has helped address the crisis, she said.",
            "Ryther, based in Seattle, currently employs two therapists on H-1B visas, out of 45 total, Ms Brady said, both of whom are from China. Without those employees, there would be nobody on staff with the linguistic and cultural knowledge to communicate with families from similar backgrounds.",
            "\"They match some of our clients in a way that American workers don't,\" she said. \"I can't replace that.\"",
            "In a research note, Atakan Bakiskan, an economist at the investment bank Berenberg, lowered his estimate for US growth from 2% at the start of the year to 1.5%, saying said the $100,000 H-1B fee is part of the Trump administration's broader \"anti-growth policymaking\".",
            "\"With the new H-1B policy, the labour force is more likely to shrink than expand going forward,\" he said. \"The brain drain will weigh heavily on productivity.\"",
            "'A great solution'",
            "In his executive order, Trump justified the new fee by referring to \"abuse\" of the H-1B programme, a nod to longstanding concern across the political spectrum that companies have used the programme to hire foreign staff at lower wages.",
            "His administration is also working on a wider overhaul of the programme, which is typically overwhelmed by applications for the roughly 85,000 new visas available each year, including a proposal to prioritise applications for higher paid workers.",
            "Trump's initial announcement won praise from some, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, who broke from many of his fellow tech leaders, calling the fee a \"great solution\".",
            "Supporters of the change have said the major tech companies, like Amazon and Microsoft, that are the biggest beneficiaries of the programme, have the money to swallow the new charge.",
            "\"If these are really specialised people, and they're bringing in a lot of value, $100,000 shouldn't be a big deal for those employers,\" said Ronil Hira, a political science professor at Howard University who focuses on US immigration policy.",

            "But policies that make it harder for companies to hire skilled positions also often prompt firms to offshore their operations, rather than hire US workers at an equivalent skill level, said Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School focused on global migration and entrepreneurship.",
            "\"These policies really don't have the intended effect of balancing the labour market competitiveness of American workers,\" Prof Wang said. \"There's not a trace of data that suggests that American workers would benefit from this.\"",
            "Elise Fialkowski is co-chair of the corporate immigration practice at Klasko Immigration Law Partners, which works with both startups and larger corporations.",

            "Trump's executive order \"almost begs companies to offshore work\", she said.",
            "Despite the reprieve, Mr Singh said he was still considering leaving his startup if he could find a job in his home country of India, or elsewhere - Canada, Japan, South Korea - worried the administration will continue to harden policies against immigrants.",
